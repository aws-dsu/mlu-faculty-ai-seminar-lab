# 1-Day Faculty AI Seminar — Plan Summary

**Audience:** Multidisciplinary faculty (Computer Science → Dentistry → Humanities → Business → Health Sciences). All have an institutional mandate to incorporate AI into their teaching.
**Format:** Single day, 9:00 AM – 4:00 PM
**Source material:** [aws-mlu-eep-generative-ai](./aws-mlu-eep-generative-ai/) (MLU EEP curriculum — 14 lessons, 13 labs across 3 modules)

---

## Goals

By 4 PM, each participant leaves with:
1. A working **PartyRock app** they built themselves
2. A working **SageMaker Studio notebook** grounded in *their own* discipline's content
3. A persona-based template for how AI fits into their existing course
4. Confidence to explain Responsible AI risks to their department

---

## What we can realistically cover

Of the 14 lessons + 13 labs in the source repo, we have ~5.5 hours of teaching time after breaks. We deliberately **trade breadth for depth + hands-on**.

**Covered in depth:**
- Module 1, Lesson 1 — Intro to Generative AI
- Module 1, Lesson 3 — Prompt Engineering (foundation for both labs)
- Hands-on: PartyRock lesson-plan app (Bootcamp Prep Part 1)
- Hands-on: SageMaker Studio RAG app (adapted from existing M3 Lab 3a)

**Surveyed only (no hands-on):**
- Module 2 — Responsible AI (Evaluating LLMs, key risks)
- Module 3 — What's next (RAG concept, Agents, Multimodal)

**Not covered:** M1 L2/L4/L5, M2 labs, M3 Lessons 1–2 + 4–5, all other labs. We point participants to the GitHub repo for self-study.

## Lab 1 — PartyRock (already designed)

Pulled directly from the existing **"EEP Generative AI Faculty Fellows Bootcamp preparation"** PDF. Participants build a lesson-plan-generator AI app, then iteratively extend it with prompt engineering, Theme/Persona widgets, and grounded references.

**Why first:** No-code on-ramp. Builds confidence for non-technical faculty before we touch a notebook.

---

## Lab 2 — SageMaker Studio (new, but ~90% built)

**Title:** "Build a Discipline-Specific AI Teaching Assistant"

**What it does:** Each participant uploads a document from their own discipline (syllabus, case study, lab protocol, primary source, etc.) into a SageMaker Studio notebook. The notebook walks them through:

1. Notebook tour + Bedrock SDK basics *(instructor-led, 15 min)*
2. Direct prompting via code — same as PartyRock but you can see the wires *(hands-on, 15 min)*
3. Upload your document → RAG Q&A grounded in that document *(hands-on, 35 min)*
4. Generate an assessment or study guide from the document *(hands-on, 20 min)*
5. Pod share-out *(5 min)*

**Why second:** Shows the code underneath PartyRock, demonstrates *grounding* (no hallucination) which is the #1 faculty concern, and produces something they can actually adapt for their class.

### Doability check ✓

Every component of Lab 2 already exists in the source repo as a working notebook. We are **composing**, not building from scratch:

| Lab 2 Section | Source Notebook |
|---|---|
| Notebook tour / Bedrock setup | `M1/Lab-2/lab2a-introduction-to-amazon-bedrock.ipynb` |
| Direct prompting, model swap | `M1/Lab-2/lab2b-chat_amazon_bedrock.ipynb` |
| PDF upload + chunking + embeddings + FAISS vector store + RAG Q&A | `M3/Lab-3/lab3a-retrieval_augmented_generation.ipynb` |
| Assessment generation | Repurposes M3 Lab 3a quiz section |

**Work required by instructors:**
- Fork `lab3a-retrieval_augmented_generation.ipynb`
- Swap the demo PDF (`transformers_paper.pdf`) for participant-provided documents
- Replace demo queries with discipline-agnostic prompt templates (quiz / study guide / rubric)
- Stage 4–6 sample PDFs in `data/` as fallback for anyone who didn't bring material
- **Estimated effort: 2–4 hours of notebook editing**

### Pre-flight checklist

- [ ] Bedrock model access enabled per AWS account: `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`, `amazon.nova-2-multimodal-embeddings-v1:0`, `mistral.mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0:1` (for Part 2 model swap)
- [ ] SageMaker Studio domain pre-provisioned (kernel cold-starts will eat 5–10 min otherwise)
- [ ] Kernels pre-warmed before lunch ends (so 1:30 PM start is instant)
- [ ] **6 sample PDFs sourced, license-checked, and staged in `data/`** (one per persona — see catalog below)
- [ ] Persistent Slack channel created for Part 5 share-outs (lives beyond seminar)

### Lab 2 — Locked design decisions

| # | Part | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Part 1 (Notebook Tour) | **Watch only** — instructor screen-shares; non-coders don't click along |
| 2 | Part 2 (Direct Prompting) | Model swap: **Nova Lite vs Mistral Mixtral** *(Anthropic Claude not enabled in MLU training accounts)* |
| 3 | Part 2 (Direct Prompting) | **Pre-fill** the prompt cell with a fun seed (haiku about your field) |
| 4 | Part 3 (Upload + RAG) | **Provide 6 sample PDFs** (one per persona). BYO is optional only. |
| 5 | Part 3 (Upload + RAG) | PDF size cap: **~50 pages** |
| 6 | Part 4 (Take It Home) | Show **all 3 prompt templates** (quiz, study guide, rubric) |
| 7 | Part 4 (Take It Home) | Include a **final cell that exports AI output to PDF/markdown** |
| 8 | Part 5 (Share-out) | Share-outs land in a **persistent Slack channel** |

### Sample PDF catalog (to source)

Public-domain or CC-licensed only. Don't use Harvard Business cases or copyrighted textbooks — sets a bad example for faculty.

| Persona | Sample document | Length | Suggested source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Dentistry | Clinical periodontal case study | 15–25 pp | PubMed Central open access, LibreTexts Dental |
| 2. Computer Science | Data structures chapter | 20–30 pp | "Open Data Structures" (Pat Morin, CC-BY), MIT OCW |
| 3. English Literature | Victorian primary source essay/short story | 10–20 pp | Project Gutenberg (Seacole, Dickens, Wilde) |
| 4. Nursing | Pharmacology chapter / drug class | 15–25 pp | OpenStax "Pharmacology for Nurses," LibreTexts Medicine |
| 5. Business | Open-access leadership case | 10–20 pp | MIT OCW Sloan, IIMA/Ivey free cases |
| 6. Biology | Real lab protocol | 8–15 pp | OpenStax Bio lab manual, JoVE open protocols |

**Naming convention:** `data/persona1_dentistry_perio_case.pdf` (self-documenting).
**Instructor demo PDF:** Lead with Persona 1 (Dentistry) — clinical reasoning creates the strongest "wow, this could work for me too" moment in a mixed room.

---

## Faculty Personas

Six personas to print as handouts and project during the 9:15 welcome. Each attendee identifies the closest match at registration so we can pre-stage their sample PDF and group them at lunch.

| # | Persona | Field | AI Comfort | Key PartyRock Use | Key SageMaker Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Dr. Maya Patel | Dentistry — Periodontics | Cautious | Case-study coach | RAG-grounded clinical reasoning Q&A |
| 2 | Prof. James Chen | Computer Science — Data Structures | High | "Code Critique" (no answers) | Textbook-grounded TA bot |
| 3 | Dr. Sarah Whitman | English — Victorian Lit | Skeptical | Primary-source discussion prompts | Citation-grounded close-reading tool |
| 4 | Prof. Diane Okafor | Nursing — Pharmacology | Moderate | Med-calc drill app | Formulary-grounded practice tool |
| 5 | Dr. Marcus Reyes | Business — Leadership MBA | Enthusiastic | Case-prep companion | Stakeholder roleplay simulator |
| 6 | Dr. Lena Hoffmann | Biology — Cell Bio Lab | Low | Pre-lab knowledge gate | Protocol-grounded Q&A |

> **Instructor tip:** Lead the SageMaker demo with **Persona 1 (Dentistry)** or **Persona 4 (Nursing)**. Clinical examples create stronger "if it works for them, it works for me" momentum in a mixed room than CS demos.

Full persona stories with vision statements and pain points are in [the seminar persona deck — TODO link].

## Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| SageMaker kernel cold-start eats lab time | Pre-warm kernels before lunch ends |
| Non-coder panic at first notebook cell | Frame sections 1–2 as "watch, don't touch"; everyone touches the RAG step |
| Participant forgets to bring their document | 4–6 sample PDFs pre-staged in `data/` |
| Skeptics (Persona 3) check out | Lead with grounding/citation demos; RAG-vs-vanilla comparison widget is the killer feature |
| Bedrock cost overrun | Default to Nova Lite (frugal); cap embedding doc size; tip from M3 L3a built in |
| Running over time | Lecture blocks compress, not labs. Cut the M2/M3 survey before cutting hands-on. |

## Open decisions for instructor team

1. **Persona selection** — keep all 6, or trim to 4 based on actual registrant disciplines?
2. **Sample-PDF curation owner** — who sources, license-checks, and stages the 6 sample PDFs? (~2–3 hrs of work — see catalog in Lab 2 section)
3. **Bridge segment (1:15–1:30)** — who delivers and what's the framing? Suggested angle: "PartyRock for prototyping, SageMaker when you need control + grounding."
4. **Take-home artifact bundle** — do we ship participants a `.zip` with their notebook + 3 prompt templates + persona handout + repo link?
5. **Post-seminar follow-up** — office hours? Curriculum review of their actual courses? (Slack channel is already locked for share-outs — could double as the follow-up channel.)
6. **SageMaker pre-flight doc** — the MLU bootcamp prep PDFs don't cover SageMaker setup at all. Do we write a short instructor-facing checklist for the morning-of, or rely on the M3 Lab 3a README?
