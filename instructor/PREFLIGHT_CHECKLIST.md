# Lab 2 — Pre-Flight Checklist

**For:** The instructor team setting up Lab 2 infrastructure before the seminar.
**Companion docs:** `INSTRUCTOR_CHEATSHEET.md` (run-of-show), `SEMINAR_PLAN.md` (full agenda).

The MLU bootcamp materials don't cover SageMaker setup — they assume you stay in PartyRock all day. We added Lab 2, so this setup is fully on us.

## Timeline

| When | What | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| **2 weeks before** | Source 6 sample PDFs | — |
| **1 week before** | AWS accounts + Bedrock model access provisioned | — |
| **3 days before** | Full dry run on a real attendee account | — |
| **Day before** | Sample PDFs uploaded to all accounts | — |
| **Morning of** | Kernels pre-warmed, Slack channel live | — |

Assign an owner for each row before scheduling.

## 2 weeks before — content prep

### Sample PDFs (the biggest open item)

- [ ] All 6 sample PDFs sourced (see `data/README.md` for spec)
- [ ] License documentation saved alongside each PDF
- [ ] Each PDF passes the test checklist in `data/README.md`:
  - [ ] Loads cleanly in `PyPDFLoader`
  - [ ] Chunks to 15–60 chunks
  - [ ] Embedding completes in < 90 seconds
  - [ ] Demo questions produce substantive answers
  - [ ] Grounded vs. vanilla comparison shows meaningful difference
- [ ] PDFs staged in a shared location (S3 bucket? Git LFS? Shared drive?) so they can be copied to every attendee's account

### Notebook

- [ ] `seminar-lab2-discipline-assistant.ipynb` reviewed by all instructors
- [ ] Package versions pinned (`langchain`, `langchain-aws`, `langchain-community`, `faiss-cpu`, `pypdf`) — version drift breaks notebooks
- [ ] Notebook executes top-to-bottom on a clean SageMaker Studio instance without errors

---

## 1 week before — AWS infrastructure

### Per-attendee AWS account access

- [ ] Each registered attendee has an AWS account (or shared seminar account with IAM users)
- [ ] Region locked to `us-east-1` (Bedrock model availability assumes this)
- [ ] SageMaker Studio domain created in each account
- [ ] IAM execution role for SageMaker has Bedrock invoke permissions

### Bedrock model access

Bedrock models require **per-account opt-in**. This is the #1 thing that fails on seminar day. Verify in the Bedrock console under "Model access" for each account:

- [ ] `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` — for Q&A and direct prompting
- [ ] `amazon.nova-2-multimodal-embeddings-v1:0` — for RAG embeddings
- [ ] `anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` — for Part 2 comparison
  - *Verify exact model ID is still current — Anthropic publishes new Haiku versions periodically*

### SageMaker Studio domains

- [ ] Instance type: `ml.t3.medium` or larger (smaller instances run out of memory during embedding)
- [ ] Kernel: Python 3 (Data Science) image, or whatever matches the package install in cell 1.1
- [ ] EFS storage allocated (5 GB minimum per user — vector store can be a few hundred MB)
- [ ] Internet access enabled (needed for `pip install` in cell 1.1)

---

## 3 days before — dry run

**Do not skip this step.** Find someone outside the instructor team and have them run the notebook end-to-end on a real attendee account.

- [ ] They can log into SageMaker Studio without help
- [ ] Notebook opens with no errors
- [ ] All 6 sample PDFs are visible in the `data/` folder
- [ ] Default PDF path works (Persona 1 Dentistry)
- [ ] All cells execute top to bottom without errors
- [ ] Total time from launch to Part 5 ≤ 90 minutes
- [ ] Generated outputs are substantive

**If anything fails:** Fix it now, not seminar morning. Most fixable issues found during dry runs are package version mismatches or Bedrock access not propagated.

---

## Day before — content distribution

- [ ] All 6 sample PDFs copied to every attendee's `data/` folder
- [ ] Notebook copied to every attendee's SageMaker Studio home
- [ ] Verify on at least 3 random attendee accounts: open notebook, run Parts 1–3, confirm no errors
- [ ] Persona-PDF mapping decided based on registration (which persona each attendee picked)
- [ ] Default `pdf_path` in each attendee's notebook updated to their persona (or left at Persona 1 as universal default)
- [ ] Slack workspace ready, persona threads pre-created in the share-out channel
- [ ] Backup plan documented (see below)

---

## Morning of — final pre-flight (8:30 AM)

The seminar starts at 9. Lab 2 starts at 1:30. You have all morning to pre-warm.

### 8:30 – 9:00 (before participants arrive)

- [ ] Sign in to your instructor SageMaker Studio account
- [ ] Open the notebook
- [ ] Run cells 1.1 – 1.3 (warms the kernel for your demo)
- [ ] Confirm both Nova Lite and Claude Haiku respond (run Part 2)
- [ ] Confirm sample dentistry PDF loads and embeds (run Part 3.2 – 3.4)
- [ ] Leave the notebook open in a tab — you'll come back to it after lunch

### During PartyRock (11:00 – 12:30)

- [ ] Spot-check that 3 attendee accounts also have warm kernels (have a TA do this)
- [ ] Monitor Slack for "I can't sign into AWS" messages — catch infrastructure issues during PartyRock, not during Lab 2

### Lunch (12:30 – 1:15)

- [ ] **Pre-warm all attendee kernels.** Open the notebook on each account and run cell 1.2 (imports). This eats the kernel startup time so 1:30 is instant.
  - Tip: scripted approach is faster than clicking through each account
- [ ] Confirm projection equipment ready
- [ ] Slack channel pinned to top of workspace

### Bridge (1:15 – 1:30)

- [ ] Lab 2 instructor takes seat at front
- [ ] Notebook open and visible on projector
- [ ] Dentistry sample PDF path set as default in instructor notebook

## Backup plans

### If Bedrock model access fails for an attendee

- Fallback model IDs to try (in order):
  1. `amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` (replaces Nova Lite)
  2. `anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` (replaces Claude Haiku)
- If even fallbacks fail: pair them with another attendee for the lab

### If SageMaker Studio is slow/down for everyone

- Run the notebook locally on the instructor laptop, project it as a demo-only
- Have attendees follow along visually
- Lose hands-on but preserve learning

### If the embedding cell fails for everyone

- This means Bedrock embeddings model isn't accessible
- Pivot to text-only Q&A: replace `vectordb.as_retriever()` with passing the raw PDF text directly to the model
- Loses the RAG architecture lesson but keeps the workflow

### If the network is bad

- Pre-download all PDFs into the SageMaker instances (no S3 dependency)
- Disable the `pip install` cell (pre-install packages in the Studio image)

---

## Post-seminar (within 1 week)

- [ ] Archive notebooks + Slack share-outs
- [ ] Survey attendees: what did you actually use Monday? (the real metric)
- [ ] Document issues that came up → update this checklist for next time
- [ ] Decommission AWS accounts or transfer ownership to attendees
